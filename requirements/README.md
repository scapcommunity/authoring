# Organization-Specific Use Cases and Requirements

This folder holds the SCAP Authoring use cases and requirements of specific organizations. These documents were 
contributed by the respective organizations and/or gathered by members of the working group.

It is our intention to gather use cases and requirements from a wide variety of organizations that currently
author or tailor SCAP content (OVAL and/or XCCDF) including, for example:

- NIST
- DISA
- CIS
- Siemens
- Red Hat
- Canonical
- Joval
- (please add more here!)

Once we have gathered these organization-specific use cases, the working group will collaborate to assess the overlap
and develop a general set of requirements for SCAP authoring to tools.
